We are lived by powers we pretend to understand:
They arrange our loves; it is they who direct at the end
The enemy bullet, the sickness, or even our hand.

--W. H. Auden, "In Memory of Ernst Toller"

In Geoffrey Hill's _Funeral Music_ he claims that death cuts short a life "not finished":
Then tell me, love,
How that should comfort us—or anyone
Dragged half-unnerved out of this worldly place,
Crying to the end ‘I have not finished’.
